										 the planets, and the stars . It also includes objects we can only see with 
										telescopes or other instruments, like faraway galaxies and tiny particles.
										Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and the phenomena
										that occur in the cosmos. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order 
										   to explain their origin and their overall evolution. Objects of interest 
										  include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, 
														and comets.
